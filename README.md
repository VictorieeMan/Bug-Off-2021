# Bug_Off__2021
 For the itch.io gaming jam "Game Off 2021"
 https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021
 
 Game Off is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. Participate individually, or as a team. Use whatever game engines, libraries, and languages you like. 

The theme for this year's Game Off is...


BUG! 

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a game between now and December 1 incorporating the theme somehow. After a few weeks of playing and rating the games by participants, the winners will be announced shortly thereafter.

As usual, you may interpret ‘BUG’ however you wish …

BUG (/bəɡ/)

noun

    an insect or creepy crawly
    an unexpected defect, fault, flaw, or imperfection in code or equipment
    a microorganism (such as a bacterium or virus) causing illness or disease
    a concealed listening device
    a sudden enthusiasm
    a river in Ukraine 

verb

    to bother or annoy or pester
    to plant a listening device
    to “bug off” or “bug out” 

Or go rogue and ignore the dictionary:

    B.U.G acronyms e.g. Being Unusually Good or Big Urban Game or something
    Dad jokes / puns like deterants / tick tock / spelling bee / flywheel 

Note: Nobody’s judging the code quality, so lots of bugs are both expected and accepted. Focus on having fun 😉

Good luck, have fun, and sign up now if you haven’t already! <3
